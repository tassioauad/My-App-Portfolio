# My-App-Portfolio
A part of the Android Developer Nanodegree program. Designed and built an app that shows off the projects created as part of the Android Developer Nanodegree program.

##Why this Project?

The goals of this project are:

* For you to build an app layout that showcases the apps you will build across your Nanodegree journey.
* To introduce you to the process of submitting a project for review. You will be expected to submit projects for review throughout the program, so it's important that you go through the process early.
* To familiarize you with the experience of receiving feedback on your work from Udacity reviewers. Sharing and receiving feedback on your code is a key part of the Nanodegree program.
* Note: Unlike your other projects, this first project will not be evaluated as "pass" or "no pass" -- all submissions will pass and get feedback.
